## Next Steps (for remaining 11 languages):
The same translation keys need to be added to:
- locales/es.json (Spanish)
- locales/fr.json (French)
- locales/ar.json (Arabic)
- locales/zh.json (Chinese)
- locales/pt.json (Portuguese)
- locales/ja.json (Japanese)
- locales/he.json (Hebrew)
- locales/ro.json (Romanian)
- locales/ru.json (Russian)
- locales/hi.json (Hindi)
- locales/it.json (Italian)

Each language file needs the translations added in the appropriate language at the same location in the JSON structure.
